\end{enumerate}

\section{General Description}
At the core of our software architecture lies the microcontroller, serving as the pivotal component responsible for overseeing all of HomeSafe's operations. This microcontroller is the nexus, intricately linked to all the physical elements housed within HomeSafe. It adeptly manages inputs from various input devices and orchestrates the delivery of corresponding outputs to designated output devices. To enable its functionality, the microcontroller is programmed using our custom-developed software, ensuring the precise execution of desired operations.

    \label{fig:diagram1}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Keypad}: The software permits users to enter their assigned PIN using the numeric keys 0-9. Any key press triggers the LED display screen and speaker to offer visual and auditory feedback. Upon successful identity verification via the correct passkey, the software sends a signal to the microcontroller, activating the iris scanner for two-factor authentication (2FA). After inputting the entire PIN, the user must press the ENTER button to initiate password verification. In the case of an erroneous number entry during PIN input, the user can press the CANCEL button to abort the entry attempt and reset the procedure.
    \item \textbf{Iris Scanner}: The software allows users to input data through the Iris Scanner after successfully verifying the PIN. After completing the PIN verification, the system will prompt the user for an iris scan. Once the iris scan is completed and the user's identity is confirmed, access to the safeGUI is granted. Visual and auditory notifications are provided through the LED Display and Speaker, and a signal is sent to the Lock System to switch the safeGUI's status from LOCKED to UNLOCKED.
    \item \textbf{Power}: When you press this button, the system will initiate, showing the main menu for PIN input on the LED Display. A startup sound will also emanate from the Speaker, signaling the user that the system is operational. It's important to note that the system can only be powered off when in the LOCKED state. If the user tries to power off the procedure while in this state, a warning message will be displayed on the LED screen.
    \item \textbf{Lock Sensors}: The interface tasked with conveying the current status of the HomeSafe (whether in the LOCKED or UNLOCKED state) to the microcontroller.
    \item \textbf{LED Display}: The LED (Light Emitting Diode) display is a visual interface for user interaction. Its primary role is to initiate user input and, when input is made via the keypad, to provide feedback by indicating the current number of characters entered. Furthermore, it can convey additional information, such as system warnings or low-power notifications, to the user.
    \item \textbf{Speaker}: A micro-speaker is integrated into the HomeSafe to convey auditory feedback to the user when buttons are pressed.
    \item \textbf{Lock Mechanism}: This system's role is to authorize entry into the HomeSafe once user authentication is completed. Upon successful authentication, the microcontroller transmits a signal to the lock mechanism, releasing the latch and making the door accessible for the user to open. This system also communicates with the Lock Sensors, which transmit this information to the software and allow further operation.
    
\end{itemize}

\section{Specific Requirements}
In this section, we take a deep dive into the inner workings of the system logic and how it reacts to the full spectrum of user interactions. We'll uncover how our software interprets and handles these interactions, giving you a clear picture of how HomeSafe smoothly manages its operations in response to diverse user actions and inputs.

    \label{fig:diagram2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{External Interfaces}
The software residing on the microcontroller governs all communication between the input and output components. Figure 2 provides a graphical representation of the physical input channels and the feasible output channels they can activate. Section 3.1 elaborates on the dynamics of interactions occurring between these inputs and outputs, while Section 3.2 illustrates the system's control flow using transition-state models.

\subsubsection{Input Events}
The interaction between users and the safeGUI is facilitated through the keypad, iris scanner, and lock sensors, each serving a vital role in ensuring security and accessibility.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Keypad}: As the primary means of user authentication, the user can input their designated PIN using the numeric keys 0-9 through the software. Each keypress triggers the LED display screen and speaker to provide visual and auditory feedback. When the correct passkey is entered, confirming the user's identity, the software communicates with the microcontroller to activate the iris scanner for two-factor authentication (2FA). To initiate password verification, the user must press the ENTER button after entering the complete PIN.
    \item \textbf{Iris Scanner}: This system represents the second user authentication layer. After successful PIN verification, the software allows users to input data through the Iris Scanner. After validating the PIN, the system prompts the user for an iris scan. Upon the successful completion of the iris scan and the subsequent confirmation of the user's identity, access to the safeGUI is authorized. Visual and auditory notifications are provided through the LED Display and Speaker to enhance user understanding and engagement. Simultaneously, a signal is dispatched to the Lock System, orchestrating the transition of the safeGUI's status from LOCKED to UNLOCKED, ensuring a robust and multi-tiered security approach.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Output Events}
The channels where the safeGUI interacts with the input mechanisms are the LED Display, Speaker, and Lock System.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LED Display}: The LED display serves as a visual interface for user interaction, primarily initiating input and providing character count feedback when using the keypad. Additionally, it communicates important system information, such as warnings and low-power notifications, to the user.
    \item \textbf{Speaker}: A micro-speaker is seamlessly integrated into the HomeSafe, designed to deliver crucial auditory output events to the user in response to button presses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Internal Interfaces}
This subsection delves into the essential internal components that make the system function seamlessly: the microcontroller, software, locking mechanism, and lock sensors.

\subsubsection{Microcontroller}
Serving as the system's central intelligence hub, the microcontroller is powered by the batteries and acts as the core decision-making unit. It receives and interprets various inputs, ensuring they are processed accurately before conveying any corresponding output to the user. In addition, the microcontroller requires power to store and manage crucial user data, including PINs and biometric information, contributing to the system's robust security framework.

\subsubsection{Software}
The software is the critical bridge between the user and the system's hardware components. It operates with the microcontroller to manage user interactions and authentication processes. The software ensures that the user's input is processed correctly, and it facilitates communication between the various hardware components to provide a seamless and secure user experience.

\subsubsection{Lock Mechanism}
The lock mechanism's primary role is granting entry into the HomeSafe once user authentication is completed. Upon successful authentication, the microcontroller, in conjunction with the software, transmits a signal to the lock mechanism, effectively releasing the latch and permitting the user to access the contents of the safeGUI.

\subsubsection{Lock Sensors}
Integral to the security of the HomeSafe, the lock sensors continuously monitor the status of the safeGUI's door, accurately detecting whether the locking mechanism is in a locked or unlocked state. This crucial information is communicated to the microcontroller and software, ensuring real-time awareness of the safeGUI's security status and allowing the system to respond promptly to user actions and the safeGUI's condition.

\subsection{Control Logic}
The control flow of the system orchestrates various operations to ensure the secure and efficient functionality of the safeGUI. This section outlines the process of setting up initial user credentials and subsequent actions within the system.

\subsubsection{Initial Setup Process}
This control logic section facilitates users configuring their PIN and adding their biometric information (specifically, an iris scan) for authorization to unlock the safeGUI. When a user purchases the safeGUI, it is delivered in a locked state with a functioning battery and an active keypad. The user who performs the initial setup automatically gains administrative access to the safeGUI. \\ \\
The safeGUI includes a paper manual containing a unique 6-digit code printed on the last page. When the system is powered on for the first time, the user will be prompted to input this unique code before configuring their credentials. Once this initial step is completed, the user will be guided to enter their 6-digit PIN. After entering six numbers and confirming them, the system will request the entry of the unique code once more. Subsequently, the user will be asked to provide a biometric scan of their iris. \\ \\
Once the user's PIN and iris scans are successfully recorded within the system, the safeGUI will be unlocked, and the user's credentials will be securely stored. It's important to note that after the initial user has configured their credentials, the initial setup process becomes inaccessible, as it is permanently locked within the microprocessor and can only be re-enabled by the manufacturer.

    \caption{Dynamic OMT Diagram of the Initial Setup Process \cite{lucidLucidVisual}}
    \label{fig:diagram3}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Authorization}
Within the framework of the control logic, this segment orchestrates the critical aspect of user authorization to access the safeGUI, commencing with a locked door and an enabled keypad. The user initiates this sequence by activating the safeGUI's power and entering their PIN on the keypad. If the system identifies the entered PIN, a secondary verification step prompts the user to re-enter the PIN for confirmation. \\ \\
Once the system successfully validates the PIN, it activates the Iris Scanner, implementing a robust two-factor authentication (2FA) protocol. Subsequently, the user is guided to perform an Iris Scan on the Display. Upon the successful completion of the initial scan, the system further enhances security by requesting an additional iris scan for verification purposes, thereby ensuring a comprehensive and robust user authentication process.

    \label{fig:diagram4}
\end{figure}

\section{Design Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The control software for HomeSafe is crafted using Java, which means it operates within the confines and opportunities presented by an object-oriented programming language. This choice of language enables a structured and modular design approach, allowing for the efficient management of complex system behaviors. However, it also implies certain limitations associated with Java-based applications' performance and resource utilization.
    \item The auxiliary power supply, a single CR2032 cell battery, can sustain the system for an estimated ten years \cite{microbatteryEverythingNeed}. However, suppose the additional power supply depletes before the primary power source is reinstated (two non-rechargeable alkaline AA batteries). All user data will be forfeited, rendering the unit's contents inaccessible. Additionally, due to the microcontroller's exclusive control over the lock mechanism, manual operation of the safeGUI box is not feasible. Consequently, should both the primary and secondary power sources fail, none of the users will possess the means to access HomeSafe.
    \item The HomeSafe is 12 x 16 x 12 inches (L x W x H). This may limit how much the customer can store inside.
