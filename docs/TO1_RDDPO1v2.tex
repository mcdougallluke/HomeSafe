\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Keypad}: The secondary source of authentication. Once the bio-metric scan is complete, users must input their six-digit PIN using the number keys labeled 0-9. If the user enters an incorrect PIN or lets more than three seconds elapse after input, the system will reset the user's attempt. After three failed attempts, the user will be restricted access and need an administrator's PIN to regain access.
    \item \textbf{Red X Key}: If a user makes an incorrect entry during PIN entry, they can press this button to reset their attempt. This will not be counted as a failed attempt.
    \item \textbf{Green Circle Key}: The user must press this button after entering all six digits of their PIN. Upon pressing this button and entering the correct PIN, the latches will be released, allowing the user access.
    \item \textbf{LED Display}: The display screen acts as an interactive interface between the user and the safe. Each time a key is pressed for password entry, an asterisk (*) appears on the screen to indicate the number of digits entered. This feature is designed to enhance user experience by providing real-time feedback.
    \item \textbf{Iris Scanner}: The primary source of authentication. Once the user provides a retinal scan, the microcontroller will enable communication with the keypad. This will prompt the user to input their six-digit code using the keypad on the LED Display.
    \item \textbf{Speaker}: Provides auditory feedback to the user when interacting with the user interface.
    \item \textbf{Volume Buttons}: The user can increase or decrease volume levels.
    \item \textbf{Power Button}: Powers the system on or off when pressed. \textbf{NOTE}: The system cannot be powered off if the locking mechanism is unlocked (safe door is open position).
    \item \textbf{Door Handle}: Used to open the safe once the latches have been released after successful authentication.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Interior Design}
In this section, we explore the internal architecture of HomeSafe, focusing on its quality materials and advanced technologies.

This ensures that your settings and user data remain intact even when the primary batteries are exhausted.
    \item HomeSafe operates exclusively on batteries, so it cannot be connected to an external power source like an AC adapter. This needs to be considered for long-term maintenance.
    \item The auxiliary power supply can power the system for approximately ten years \cite{microbatteryEverythingNeed}. If the auxiliary power supply is depleted before the primary power supply is restored, all user data will be lost, and the unit's contents will not be accessible.
    \item With external dimensions of 12 x 16 x 12 inches (L x W x H), the HomeSafe offers a finite amount of storage space. Users should consider these dimensions when planning what to store inside the safe.
    \item Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is activated through a predetermined code shipped with the safe. While this enhances security, users should keep this code secure and confidential.
    \item HomeSafe is not designed to be fireproof or waterproof. Users should consider the safe's environmental limitations when choosing a location.
    \item All images of the safe were created using the DALL-E 2 generative AI technology by OpenAI \cite{openaiDALLE}. We added labels and arrows to each safe component using Microsoft Word.
\end{itemize}
