\section{Definition of Terms}
This section provides definitions for critical terms recurrently utilized throughout the document. This section can be a reference point for readers engaging with the content.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[I.] \textbf{Administrator}: An individual with authority to establish and oversee separate user profiles within the system, regulating user access to the system's settings and contents.
    \item[II.] \textbf{Auxiliary}: An additional or secondary power source that supports the main or primary power supply. An auxiliary power source is typically used to provide backup, redundancy, or temporary power when the main power source is unavailable, disrupted, or insufficient.
    \item[III.] \textbf{Bio-Metric Scanner}: A technology that identifies and authenticates users based on their unique biological characteristics, typically fingerprints, retina patterns, or other traits.
    \item[IV.] \textbf{Microcontroller}: A microcontroller is a small integrated circuit serving as the central processing unit (CPU) of a safe's electronic system. It contains a processor, memory, and input/output ports and can include programmable capabilities. Microcontrollers manage the safe's tasks, user input, security protocols, and control functions, including locks, interface interactions, and external device communication.
    \item[V.] \textbf{Personal Identification Number (PIN)}: A numerical code that serves as a security credential used to authenticate and verify the identity of an individual. PINs are commonly used in various systems, such as electronic devices, bank accounts, and access control systems, to ensure that only authorized users can gain access.
    \item[VI.] \textbf{Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)}: A security protocol that requires users to provide two distinct forms of verification to access a system. This commonly involves a combination of something known (such as a password), and something possessed (such as a generated code or biometric information), adding an extra layer of security and protection against unauthorized access \cite{identityautomationTwoFactorAuthentication}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Objectives}
Our primary aim is to create a platform within our safe that accommodates multiple individual users, granting independent access while allowing the administrator to extend access to up to six users. Simplicity of setup and maintenance has been a core objective, reflected in the user-friendly interface that ensures easy management and configuration. This convenience extends to the activation of Two-Factor Authentication, bolstering security with a biometric retina scan. This security-focused approach maintains user data integrity even during power outages, underscoring our commitment to seamless access and protection.

\subsection{Multi-User Capability}
The safe will include the functionality to store codes for numerous users. The administrator can provide access to as many as six distinct users. Each user will have the capability to unlock the safe. Additionally, the administrator can monitor the opening and closing of the safe, recording details about who accessed it and when it was shut.

\subsection{Enhanced Security with Two-Factor Authentication}
Users can opt for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to enhance security measures with an iris scanner. This involves receiving a code through their chosen 2FA method, such as biometric retina scans, which are inputted into the safe to finalize setup. Once activated, users must enter the 2FA code alongside their safe code to gain access, ensuring an added layer of protection.

\subsection{Easy Setup and Care}

When you receive HomeSafe, the setup process is made smoother with pre-installed batteries, eliminating the requirement for extra assembly. The unit is meticulously designed for user-friendly operation: just power on the safe and follow the straightforward prompts to finalize the setup. This method guarantees a seamless experience from the beginning, reducing user involvement and erasing the usual intricacies linked to initial installation.

\subsection{Uninterrupted Security and Access}
Should a power failure occur, rest assured that the safe retains its stored user data intact. However, for users who have activated 2FA, accessing the safe will necessitate the presence of the administrator to grant access in the absence of regular authentication. This safety measure underscores our commitment to maintaining data integrity and security, even during unexpected power interruptions.

\section{System Organization}
In this section, we offer an outline of the organizational structure of the HomeSafe system, encompassing insights into its user interface, internal components, and their interplay.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{docs/figs/closed_safe.png}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Keypad}: The secondary source of authentication. Once the bio-metric scan is complete, users must input their six-digit PIN using the number keys labeled 0-9 and a * character. If the user enters an incorrect PIN or lets more than three seconds elapse after input, the system will reset the user's attempt. After three failed attempts, the user will be restricted access and need an administrator's PIN to regain access.
    \item \textbf{Red X Key}: If a user makes an incorrect entry during PIN entry, they can press this button to reset their attempt. This will not be counted as a failed attempt.
    \item \textbf{Green Circle Key}: The user must press this button after entering all six digits of their PIN. Upon pressing this button and entering the correct PIN, the latches will be released, allowing the user access.
    \item \textbf{LED Display}: The display screen serves as the communication medium with the user. The display indicates the number of keys input when a password is entered. This functionality is incorporated to improve user convenience.
    \item \textbf{Iris Scanner}: The primary source of authentication. Once the user provides a retinal scan, the microcontroller will enable communication with the keypad. This will prompt the user to input their six-digit code using the keypad on the LED Display.
    \item \textbf{Speaker}: Provides auditory feedback to the user when interacting with the user interface.
    \item \textbf{Volume Buttons}: The user can increase or decrease volume levels.
    \item \textbf{Door Handle}: Used to open the safe once the latches have been released after successful authentication.
